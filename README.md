# Flower-Store-Website

Petal & Stem is a simple and responsive flower store website built using HTML and CSS. It serves as a front-end project for showcasing products, collecting customer feedback, and allowing users to get in touch through a contact form.

This website simulates a basic e-commerce platform where users can:

Explore available flower products

Read customer reviews

Use the contact form to reach out

The project is ideal for beginners learning web development and demonstrates how to structure and style a multi-page website with smooth navigation and clean layout.
